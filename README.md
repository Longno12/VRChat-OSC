    -   Go to your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and log in.
    -   Click **"Create an app"**. Give it any name and description (e.g., "VRChat OSC").
    -   Once created, copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Paste them into the matching fields in the application.
    -   In the Spotify Dashboard, go to your app's **"Settings"**.
    -   Under **"Redirect URIs"**, add this exact URL: `https://longno12.github.io/Spotify-Verify-Link-help/`

## Troubleshooting

-   **"Missing Library" error on startup:**
    -   This means the `install_requirements.bat` file was not run or failed. Run it again. If it still fails, you may need to reinstall Python, making sure you checked the **"Add Python to PATH"** option during installation.

-   **Nothing Appears in My Chatbox:**
    -   **Confirm OSC is enabled in VRChat.** This is the most common cause.
    -   Make sure you have clicked the **‚ñ∂ START** button in the application.
    -   Check that your firewall or antivirus software is not blocking Python or `python.exe` from accessing the network.

-   **Spotify Authentication Fails or shows a "Redirect URI Mismatch" error:**
    -   **Check the Redirect URI:** The most common cause is a typo. In your Spotify Developer Dashboard settings, the URI must **exactly** match `https://longno12.github.io/Spotify-Verify-Link-help/`. There should be no extra spaces or characters.
    -   **Check the Client ID/Secret:** Ensure your Client ID and Secret are copied and pasted correctly into the application with no extra spaces.
