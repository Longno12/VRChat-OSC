## How to Use

1.  **Launch the Application:**
    -   After installation is complete, double-click the main Python file (e.g., `main.py` or `VRC_OSC_Pro.py`) to run the application.
    -   If it's your first time, a pop-up will ask if you want a tutorial. Click "Yes" for a guided tour.

2.  **Configure Spotify (For music features):**
    -   Go to your [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and log in.
    -   Click **"Create an app"**. Give it any name and description (e.g., "VRChat OSC").
    -   Once created, copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Paste them into the matching fields in the Spotify panel of our application.
    -   In the Spotify Dashboard, go to your app's **"Settings"**.
    -   Under **"Redirect URIs"**, add this exact URL: `https://longno12.github.io/Spotify-Verify-Link-help/`
    -   Click **"Add"**, then scroll down and click **"Save"**.

3.  **Customize Modules and Style:**
    -   Go through the various panels (**CORE MODULES**, **STYLE & TEXT**, etc.) to enable the features you want and customize their appearance.
    -   The **Live Preview** on the right will update as you make changes.

4.  **Save Your Profile:**

5.  **Start Sending to VRChat:**
    -   Click the **â–¶ START** button.
    -   The first time you start with Spotify enabled, a browser window will open asking you to authorize the application. Log in and agree.
    -   You will be redirected to the "Capture Spotify Redirect URL" website. **Copy the entire, long URL** from your browser's address bar.
    -   Go to the **console window** that opened with the script and **paste the URL** when prompted. Press Enter.
    -   The log panel will show "Spotify Authenticated Successfully!", and the script will begin sending your custom message to the VRChat chatbox.

    -   Click the **â–  STOP** button to clear the chatbox and stop sending messages.

## Troubleshooting

-   **"Missing Library" error on startup:**
    -   This means the `install_requirements.bat` file was not run or failed. Run it again. If it still fails, you may need to reinstall Python, making sure you check the **"Add Python to PATH"** option.

-   **Nothing Appears in My Chatbox:**
    -   **Confirm OSC is enabled in VRChat.** This is the most common cause.
    -   Make sure you have clicked the **â–¶ START** button in the application.
    -   Check that your firewall or antivirus software is not blocking Python from accessing the network.

-   **Spotify Errors in the Log:**
    -   If you see "Client ID not set" or an "INVALID_CLIENT" error, double-check that you have copied and pasted your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** correctly.
    -   Ensure that the **Redirect URI** in your Spotify Developer Dashboard settings **exactly** matches `https://longno12.github.io/Spotify-Verify-Link-help/`. There should be no typos.

-   **The script closes immediately or I don't see a place to paste my Spotify URL:**
    -   You must run the script from a terminal or command prompt to be able to paste the URL. If you're having trouble, create a simple `.bat` file with the line `python main.py` (or your script's filename) and `pause` on the next line. This will keep the window open.
